# Creating an automation workflow using Gulp.js
To make it simple, in this repository I'm only automating JavaScript.

## Separating tasks.
I'm seperating my tasks to make it more modular and readable.

### Tasks
* bundling with Browserify.
* initiating the server with Nodemon.
* live loading with BrowserSync.
* running tests using Karma.

You can extend this project and add more tasks like Image optimization or SASS compilation.
